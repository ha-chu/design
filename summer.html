            <h2>overview</h2>
            <p>This is a repository of small design projects I started in the summer of 2022. Most have been done over a period of roughly 1 week or less, with the exception of style tiles (each of which has taken and is still taking me about 1-2 weeks or more). All were done in Figma unless otherwise stated.</p>
            <p>The work you'll see below is strictly for fun and learning about areas of design I've (sometimes temporarily) become intensely curious about. If you're interested in seeing more "serious" UX and product design case studies, take a look at my work <a href="iidecide.html">revamping the onboarding experience of a mobile app</a> or <a href="sj.html">designing a city government web portal</a>.</p>

            <h2>playing with ui: style tile sandboxes</h2>
            <p>I learned about style tiles, a design artifact somewhere between mood boards and mockups, during my summer internship. The designers at my agency used them to define a new project's UI direction, and I saw them as a cool early ancestor to a design system. I've ever since been playing around with style tiles by choosing an app at random and giving myself free rein to imagine (using any information I have about the app, its users, and what it does) how I might design its UI.</p>

            <h2>optimizing components for variation</h2>
            <p>This project was my opportunity to explore 2 recent interests: design systems and Figma auto-layout. Picking <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/" target="_blank">The A11y Project</a>'s website to use as a guide, I recreated (and documented) many of their web UI components in Figma, trying to test the capabilities of auto-layout for enabling easy resizing and future scalability.</p>

            <h2>exploring microinteractions</h2>
            <p>I remember reading, when I first got seriously into design, an article that a Spotify team wrote about <a href="https://spotify.design/article/bringing-the-spotify-heart-to-life" target="_blank">animating the Spotify heart button</a>. This summer at my internship, I was learning to prototype with Protopie and decided to try creating basic microinterations with the tool. Of course, I used Spotify heart-esque elements as my test subjects. The results are far less sophisticated and cool than the real things, but it was a fun experience nevertheless.</p>

            <h2>vectorizing blackletter type</h2>
            <p>Curious about typography and how icon designers manage to simplify extremely complex shapes, I tried vectorizing the Blackletter masthead logos of news organizations.</p>
