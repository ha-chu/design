            <h1>Writing clear instructions on&nbspmbta.com</h1>
            <p>Content on mbta.com helps guide transit riders through their travel. Here's how I write instructions, knowing that <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/" rel="noreferrer">most people scan and skim webpages</a> for the info they need.</p>

            <h2>Check for an email confirmation</h2>
            <p>Working with a first draft from stakeholders, I helped write a more informative confirmation message for mbta.com's <a href="https://www.mbta.com/customer-support" rel="noreferrer">customer support form</a>.</p>

            <p>Writing methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Recall exact terminology from the form [contact info].</b> This helps riders clearly determine if the instruction applies to&nbspthem.</li>
                <li><b>Use verbs like check, try, and call.</b> This gives riders explicit and active steps they can follow.</li>
                <li><b>Write precise time info [within 10 minutes].</b> This gives riders reassurance and a clear threshold for action.</li>

            <p>In an original content draft for this webpage, there was a statement telling riders that we'd update the page with more information on public meetings and project materials as it came up.</p>
            <p>I worked with stakeholders to write a more active sentence that encourages riders' participation and frames things from a rider's perspective.</p>

            <h2>[style guide] Capitalize after colons</h2>
            <p>In our content team's style guide, I updated a rule with examples to help content strategists know when to capitalize after colons.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>My first draft:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <mark id="blue">When using a colon</mark> in body copy, <mark id="blue">capitalize the first word</mark> after the colon if it begins a full sentence <mark id="orange">(ex.</mark> Note: The new fare vending machines will be installed in spring). For project stats, we also capitalize the first word after the colon (ex. Status: In progress). 
            </blockquote>
            <p>After a teammate's revision, with much better formatting:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <mark id="blue">When using a colon</mark> in body copy, <mark id="blue">capitalize the first word</mark> after the colon if it begins a full sentence. <mark id="orange">For example:</mark> "Note: The new fare vending machines will be installed in spring."

            <p>Writing methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Use a "when A, do B" or "for A, do B" format.</b> This gives situational context upfront.</li>
                <li><b>Use examples to clearly illustrate the rule.</b> This helps the team identify similar content to evaluate when to apply the rule (or not).</li>
