            <h1>Laundry</h1>
            <p>April 12, 2022</p>
            <p>When I was around eight or nine, my mom said she’d pay me a $2 flat rate to hang the family’s laundry on the skinny drying racks in our downstairs storage room. It was cheap labor and I can’t remember ever receiving the cash from her, but I loved the job.</p>
            <p>Laundry has always been one of those random things I like. Some people find bullet journaling therapeutic, others think going on jogs is fun. Doing the laundry, to me, is all at once comforting and endearing and eye-opening.</p>
            <p>After accepting my mom’s job offer, I went down to the dingy storage room of our rental home almost every week to dry the family’s clothes. To most people, I’ll bet that room was the ugliest patch of square footage in the entire house: eerie and ineffective yellow lights, too narrow for two people to walk through shoulder to shoulder, unpolished concrete floors that my mom covered with leftover packing paper from our cross-country move.</p>
            <p>But the laundry room was my gold mine. There, I worked in relative quiet for a short half hour, with only the sounds of my own rustling and the rumble of the water heater to break the silence. I was absorbed in the repetitive motion of moving a pair of jeans from laundry basket to drying rack, in taking care to smooth the wrinkles of a damp T-shirt hanging lifeless across a rod. I learned that there is privilege in getting to perform the necessary activities of life maintenance, privilege in having neat and clean clothes to wear.</p>
            <p>When I was eleven, we bought a house without a storage room and started to do our laundry in the garage. My mom no longer offered me $2 to hang the laundry; instead, I would make frequent trips to check on the status of my clothing, to see if my new hoodie had been hung up. I found it so funny, as I did when I was still the resident clothes hanger, to see everyone’s closets splayed out side by side like that. Clothes out to dry are such curious signs of life: Someone in this house must work a corporate office job, because there are countless pairs of those long black socks that men wear with dress shoes. Someone in this house must play basketball, because baggy nylon shorts in bright primary colors litter the rack. Someone in this house must be living, breathing.</p>
            <p>There is this picture in my camera roll from a few months ago where my dorm room looks absolutely ridiculous. Clothes hang from anywhere they can: our two lofted bed frames, our closet doors. The dryers weren’t working and it happened to be laundry day for all three of us. The picture makes me laugh. Our space looks so used, so lived in, so loved. ◆</p>
