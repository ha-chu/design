            <h1>Writing simply about technical&nbsptopics on mbta.com</h1>
            <p>Here's how I simplify writing about technical topics on mbta.com, so more transit riders can learn about transit improvement projects at the T.</p>

            <h2>Light rail vehicle features</h2>

            <p>I worked with Vehicle Engineering to describe the features of a new light rail vehicle model, the Type 10, in plainer terms.</p>

            <p>Writing methods:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Concrete, concise, and familiar terms: <a href=https://www.mbta.com/projects/digital-signage>digital sign</a></li>
                <li>Plainer and fewer words: <s>increased visibility</s></li>
                <li>Less repetition: <s>service information, including</s> information on service <b>and</b> disruptions</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For more information, you can <a href=https://www.mbta.com/projects/green-line-type-10-vehicles>view the project webpage</a> I later published about Type 10s.</p>

            <h2>Construction and procurement info</h2>
            <p id="heading"><a href=https://www.mbta.com/projects/transit-oriented-development-alewife>-> Transit-Oriented Development at Alewife</a></p>
            <p>I worked with Transit-Oriented Development and Public Engagement teams to turn construction and procurement language into something more colloquial.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Language used in procurement docs:</p>
            <blockquote>
                To accomplish these goals, <mark id="blue">the MBTA</mark> will <mark id="green">enter into a Pre-Development Agreement</mark> with its chosen JD partner to maximize public and private strengths of each party, and to create a <mark id="orange">development master plan</mark> that is realistic and viable.
            </blockquote>
            <p>First draft for mbta.com:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <mark id="blue">We're</mark> currently selecting a joint development partner to <mark id="green">help create</mark> a <mark id="orange">project plan</mark> that's feasible and informed by community needs.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Final adaptation for mbta.com:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <mark id="blue">We're</mark> in the process of selecting a joint development partner. We'll <mark id="green">collaborate with them</mark> on a <mark id="orange">project plan</mark> that's practical and informed by the needs of the community.

            <p>Writing methods:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pronouns and contractions to create familiarity and make reading more natural: we're, we'll</li>
                <li>Plain language: help, collaborate, project plan</li>
                <li>Break long sentences up</li>
            </ol>
