            <h1>Editing content about technical&nbsptopics for mbta.com</h1>
            <p>Here's how I simplify writing about technical topics, so more transit riders can learn about transit improvement projects at the T.</p>

            <p>I worked with Vehicle Engineering to describe the features of a new light rail vehicle model, the Type 10, in plainer terms.</p>

            <p>Writing methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Use concrete, concise, and familiar terms.</b> <a href=https://www.mbta.com/projects/digital-signage rel="noreferrer">Digital sign</a> is a known term on mbta.com.</li>
                <li><b>Use plainer and fewer words.</b> [<s>increased visibility</s>]</li>
                <li><b>Reduce repetition.</b> [<s>service information, including</s> information on service <b>and</b> disruptions]</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more information, you can <a href=https://www.mbta.com/projects/green-line-type-10-vehicles rel="noreferrer">view the project webpage</a> I later published about Type 10s.</p>

            <h2>Construction and procurement info</h2>
            <p id="heading">Live webpage: <a href=https://www.mbta.com/projects/transit-oriented-development-alewife rel="noreferrer">Transit-Oriented Development at Alewife</a></p>
            <p>I worked with Transit-Oriented Development and Public Engagement teams to turn construction and procurement language into something more colloquial.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Language used in procurement docs:</p>
            <blockquote>
                To accomplish these goals, <mark id="blue">the MBTA</mark> will <mark id="green">enter into a Pre-Development Agreement</mark> with its chosen JD partner to maximize public and private strengths of each party, and to create a <mark id="orange">development master plan</mark> that is realistic and viable.
            </blockquote>
            <p>First draft for mbta.com:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <mark id="blue">We're</mark> currently selecting a joint development partner to <mark id="green">help create</mark> a <mark id="orange">project plan</mark> that's feasible and informed by community needs.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Final adaptation for mbta.com:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <mark id="blue">We're</mark> in the process of selecting a joint development partner. We'll <mark id="green">collaborate with them</mark> on a <mark id="orange">project plan</mark> that's practical and informed by the needs of the community.

            <p>Writing methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Use pronouns and contractions.</b> This creates familiarity and makes reading more natural.</li>
                <li><b>Write in plain language.</b> Use common words like help, collaborate, project plan.</li>
                <li><b>Write shorter sentences.</b> Break one long sentence into two.</li>
