            <h1>Writing clear instructions on&nbspmbta.com</h1>
            <p>Content on mbta.com helps guide riders through actions to take and train schedules to follow. Here's how I write instructions, knowing that <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/">most people scan and skim webpages</a> for the info they need.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="standard">
            <h2>Check for an email confirmation</h2>
            <p id="heading"><a href="https://www.mbta.com/customer-support">-> Customer Support</a></p>
            <p>I rewrote the confirmation message for mbta.com's customer support form. It gives more instruction on how to check that your form submission went through, and what to do if it didn't.</p>
