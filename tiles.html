            <p>I’ve recently been interested in all things design systems, UI patterns, and component libraries, so naturally I thought style tiles were the coolest things ever when I was introduced to them during my internship at <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank">Postlight</a>. After work hours, I’ve been trying my hand at putting together style tiles for miscellaneous apps and having fun creating my alternate version of their UI style.</p>
            <p>(This project is still in progress. Check back later and there might be more to see!)</p>
