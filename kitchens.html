            <h1>Stories of Kitchens</h1>
            <p>May 16, 2022</p>
            <p>For a brief period in my life, I saw a lot of kitchens. My family had recently moved halfway across the country and, in our quest to find a house of our own, my parents took me to open houses most Sundays. When you go to that many open houses as a kid and non-homeowner, most parts of the properties eventually start looking the same. Every house had white bedrooms, forgettable bathrooms, and the same light-brown wood flooring.</p>
            <p>But the kitchen? Oh, that was where a house could shine. Some had resined, dark wood cabinets and others had colorful ones painted matte. One place we visited when I was ten—and later put a bid in for—was outfitted with a charming breakfast nook. A more modern house we saw had a kitchen island topped with bright white marble. The home we actually moved into came with no island, but rather a peninsula, if you will.</p>
            <p>What makes kitchens so important and interesting to me, I think, is the fact that you very well could end up spending half of your life in there. A bedroom is for sleeping and a closet is for dressing, but a kitchen can be for cooking family meals and preparing dinner parties and entertaining guests and hanging out with friends and doing homework and storing the kids’ toys. I have known kitchens that were all of the above.</p>
            <p>When my best friend from middle school and I were home from our second year of college, we most often hung out at her parents’ house. They had moved maybe a year prior, and their new kitchen was a dream: a beautiful island, extra peninsula, walk-in pantry, huge fridge, wine cellar, floor-to-ceiling windows, and two sinks. We easily spent entire afternoons without leaving it. We would make instant noodles and eat lunch at the island, afterwards watch a show while baking cream puffs, then pull out Twister and Disney puzzles from the peninsula cabinets when we got bored.</p>
            <p>The thing I liked most about my friend’s kitchen was how it made me feel grown-up and nostalgic at the same time. Alone and making whatever we wanted to eat in a nice kitchen, I thought that this was what being a real adult in your twenties or thirties must be like. At the same time, it reminded me of the many times I had stayed over at my best friend’s old house as a kid: Once, her mom had made us lasagna for dinner and four or five of us had crowded around the table in the kitchen to eat. A different time, another close friend was also over and the three of us cooked together for the first time, as far as I can remember. We were making instant noodles—the same kind we still cooked as college students, only in a new kitchen. The mornings after I slept over, we always piled into the kitchen at ten to have breakfast before I went home.</p>
            <p>Last time I videocalled my best friend, I was still at school but she had already arrived home for the summer. Call anytime, she told me, I’ll be making crêpes in the kitchen. ◆</p>
