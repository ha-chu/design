            <h1>Writing clear instructions on&nbspmbta.com</h1>
            <p>Content on mbta.com helps guide transit riders through their travel. Here's how I write instructions, knowing that <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/" rel="noreferrer">most people scan and skim webpages</a> for the info they need.</p>

            <h2>Check for an email confirmation</h2>
            <p>Working with a first draft from stakeholders, I helped write a more informative confirmation message for mbta.com's <a href="https://www.mbta.com/customer-support" rel="noreferrer">customer support form</a>.</p>

            <p>Writing methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Recall exact terminology from the form [contact info].</b> This helps riders clearly determine if the instruction applies to&nbspthem.</li>
                <li><b>Use verbs like check, try, and call.</b> This gives riders explicit and active steps they can follow.</li>
                <li><b>Write precise time info [within 10 minutes].</b> This gives riders reassurance and a clear threshold for action.</li>
            </ul>
