            <h1>Aerial Summer</h1>
            <p>May 18, 2022</p>
            <p>In total, I danced for more than ten years. First it was on lousy carpet-covered concrete in the high school where the weekend Chinese school with makeshift dance classes was held. Later it was on proper vinyl flooring, when my mom found me a real Chinese classical dance studio.</p>
            <p>In my first years at the studio, I realized that there were a few things I was really quite bad at. I got dizzy easily and couldn’t spot the floor on spins, was messy with slow-paced combinations and control, and proved overall to be an unemotional and inexpressive dancer. (To be fair, I was only eight.) But then, there were also things I was really quite good at. I was crazy flexible thanks to a few years of competitive rhythmic gymnastics training, could jump high and land with a light step, and most of all, I could tumble. I could really, really tumble. When the blue protective mats were rolled out across the floor, I somersaulted and cartwheeled and front walkover-ed like nobody’s business and I could do it for hours.</p>
            <p>I decided it was time to get my aerial when I was ten. To be able to do a no-handed cartwheel, at our dance school, was to hit the gold standard of aerobic competency. If you had your aerial, you were a real, mature dancer. You were ready for the big leagues. You could move on to more painful stretches, more intricate jumps, more dizzying spins, and more dangerous flips. I wanted my aerial.</p>
            <p>That summer, I must have spent half of my life running across a blue tumbling mat. I was already dancing six or seven hours a day at our studio’s summer intensive, and still, everyday, my friends and I would set up the mats at lunch and after class to throw ourselves in the air and hope we’d land. Over and over, with my number of aerial trials rising in the hundreds, I told myself that this time, I wouldn’t put my hands down. But it wasn’t that easy. I went home every evening for a month with sore wrists, dripping sweat, and no aerial yet.</p>
            <p>And then one day, I just… got it. Rather anticlimactically, I threw myself in the air and landed squarely on the other side, no hands touching the mat. I ran back to the starting end of the mat, and I did it again. Then again, and again, and again, until it became official. I had my aerial.</p>
            <p>In an email to my best friend that day, I wrote: “I,m so happy because today in dance class i did an aerial(a no-handed cartwheel)!! Enjoy the rest of your summer!!” ◆</p>
