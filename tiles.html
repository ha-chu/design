            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I discovered style tiles, a sort of intermediate step between mood boards and mockups (or, in some ways, a precursor to a full-fledged UI system), during my internship in the summer of 2022. After work hours, I’ve been trying my hand at putting together tiles for miscellaneous apps and having fun creating alternate visions for their UI.</p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>My process for creating an app's style tiles has so far been as follows: I start by picking an app and using any information I already know about it, what it does, and who its users are to begin creating a mood board. Then I use my board and some of the app's existing assets (logo and app icon) to start exploring typography and color. When I've landed on styles that feel right, I officially enter the UI playground and start creating components to my heart's desire.</p>
            <p>Below are style tiles I've made recently, all done in Figma. [This work in still in progress. Check back later and there'll be more to see!]</p>
